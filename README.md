# Simple Calculator ðŸ§®

This project was created just for fun and practice!

## Simple Mechanics, but worth the time!

This project taught and remembered me some basic concepts, such as:
- Basic HTML structure;
- CSS linking, classes, IDs and variables;
- JavaScript logic, function calls and regex;
- Integration of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a real scenario!
